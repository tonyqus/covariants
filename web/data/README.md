Files Moved
----

Due to issues with the size of the CoVariants github repository, we have had to move the locations of the perCountryData.json and perCountryDataCaseCounts.json files.

These were previously located at `github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/blob/master/web/data`

And can now be found at
`github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/blob/master/web/public/data` (note the addition of `public`)


New links:
---
[perCountryData.json](https://github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/blob/master/web/public/data/perCountryData.json)

[perCountryDataCaseCounts.json](https://github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/blob/master/web/public/data/perCountryDataCaseCounts.json)


We are aware that moving these files may cause pipelines or workflows to fail, and we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused. Unfortunately, there was no other option to keep CoVariants running.

Future Changes
----

These files may move one more time as we look for ways to constrain the growing size of the respository. These will always be announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/firefoxx66) and [Mastodon](https://mstdn.science/@firefoxx66). If you'd like to be alerted to any future changes, please reply to [this Github issue](https://github.com/hodcroftlab/covariants/discussions/386) or send an email listing the files you use to covariants [at] protonmail.com .
